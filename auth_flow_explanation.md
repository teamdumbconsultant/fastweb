# Explanation of the Authentication Flow

This document explains how the Server Actions (`login`, `logout`, `deleteAccount`) and the Supabase middleware work together to manage user authentication and sessions in this Next.js application.

## The Core Concept: Cookies and Middleware

The entire authentication system is built around HTTP cookies. Supabase uses a set of cookies (typically named `sb-access-token` and `sb-refresh-token`) to track a user's session.

-   **Server Actions** are responsible for telling the Supabase server to **create** or **destroy** a session. When this happens, Supabase instructs the browser to add, modify, or delete the authentication cookies.
-   The **Middleware** runs on **every subsequent request** to the server. Its primary job is to read the authentication cookies from the incoming request, keep the session fresh, and ensure that the server-side context is always aware of the user's current authentication state.

## Detailed Flow for Each Action

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of what happens during the `logout` and `deleteAccount` actions.

### 1. The `logout` Action

The `logout` function is a Server Action triggered when a user clicks the "Logout" button.

**File:** `src/app/login/actions.ts`
```typescript
'use server'

import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export async function logout() {
  const supabase = await createClient()
  await supabase.auth.signOut() // Step 1: Invalidate session

  revalidatePath('/', 'layout')
  redirect('/') // Step 2: Redirect
}
```

**The Process:**

1.  **`supabase.auth.signOut()`**:
    *   This function makes an API call to the Supabase server to invalidate the user's session token.
    *   Crucially, Supabase responds with instructions for the browser to **delete the authentication cookies**. The `@supabase/ssr` library handles this by setting the appropriate `Set-Cookie` headers on the HTTP response.

2.  **`redirect('/')`**:
    *   After the cookies are cleared, the server redirects the user to the homepage.
    *   When the browser makes a request for the homepage (`/`), the request is sent **without the authentication cookies** (since they were just deleted).

3.  **Middleware Execution**:
    *   The middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) runs for this new request to `/`.
    *   Inside the middleware, `supabase.auth.getUser()` is called. Since there are no valid auth cookies in the request, this function will return `{ data: { user: null } }`.
    *   The middleware then allows the request to proceed to the homepage. Any Server Component on the homepage that checks the user's status will now see that no one is logged in.

### 2. The `deleteAccount` Action

The `deleteAccount` function is very similar to logout but involves a permanent, administrative action.

**File:** `src/app/account/actions.ts`
```typescript
'use server'

import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export async function deleteAccount() {
  const supabase = await createClient()

  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

  if (user) {
    // Step 1: Delete user and invalidate session
    await supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(user.id)
  }

  revalidatePath('/', 'layout')
  redirect('/') // Step 2: Redirect
}
```

**The Process:**

1.  **`supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(user.id)`**:
    *   This is a protected administrative action that permanently deletes the user's record from the Supabase `auth.users` table.
    *   As part of this process, Supabase automatically **invalidates all of the user's active sessions**. Just like `signOut()`, this results in Supabase sending `Set-Cookie` headers to the browser to **delete the authentication cookies**.

2.  **`redirect('/')`**:
    *   The redirect and subsequent middleware execution flow is **identical to the `logout` process**. The browser is sent to the homepage, the request has no auth cookies, and the middleware confirms that the user is unauthenticated.

## Summary

In both cases, the Server Action's primary role is to perform a single, decisive authentication change (`signOut` or `deleteUser`). This change results in the auth cookies being cleared. The middleware doesn't actively participate in the logout *action* itself, but it plays the critical role of validating the *result* of that action on the very next page navigation, ensuring the entire application is aware of the user's new, unauthenticated state.
